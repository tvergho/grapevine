/**
 * This is a patch wrapper for the React Native `reanimated-bottom-sheet`.
 *
 * Problems solved:
 * - onCloseEnd was firing as soon as the sheet's mounted, even before its opening. https://github.com/osdnk/react-native-reanimated-bottom-sheet/issues/136
 * - onCloseEnd was not firing on repeated closings. https://github.com/osdnk/react-native-reanimated-bottom-sheet/issues/183
 * - Other open/close events were silent sometimes.
 *
 * How to use:
 * 1. Make sure you have the imported below modules installed.
 * 2. Put this file to your project folder.
 * 3. `import BottomSheet from './ReanimatedBottomSheet_patched'` -Â import this patched version to where you need the `BottomSheet`.
 * 4. Use the `BottomSheet` as you would normally do.
