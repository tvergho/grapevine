# RecTree

RecTree is a mobile app that rewards users for recommending their favorite businesses to their friends. In contrast to individualized review sites and complicated, expensive referral marketing programs, our app provides a single, centralized platform for users to sign up, connect with their friends, and receive cashback rewards for recommending businesses on the platform.

This repo currently hosts RecTree, which we plan to debut exclusively for Ithaca businesses in the coming weeks. The mobile application is built on React Native, while our backend is a serverless application hosted on AWS. Our tech stack also includes industry-standard frameworks such as Firebase for user authentication and Plaid for effortless purchase verification.
